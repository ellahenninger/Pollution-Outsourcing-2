## Code Structure

The code in **replication_code.rmd** is structured as follows:

1. Set up

2. Preparatory steps
- Load data
- Create lagged and logged variables

3. Descriptives
- Table summary statistics
- Correlations
- Trends

4. Analyses
- Models democracy and pollution outsourcing: Model group 1
- Models pollution outsourcing and environmental performance: Model group 2
- Plots model group 1
- Plots model group 2

5. Quantities of interest
- Simulated interaction effects
- Marginal effects plots
- Expected values: Model group 1 (within)
- Expected values: Model group 1 (Between)
- Expected values & first differences: Model group 2 (within)
- Expected values & first differences: Model group 2 (between)

6. Robustness checks
- Replacing DV with PM2.5
- Replacing DV with carbon footprint
- Different outsourcing variables
- Alternative operationalization outsourcing
- Alternative operationalization democracy
- Additional controls
- Drop high-income states
- Sample split instead of interaction term
